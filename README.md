## Button Component

This button component is built with Angular 20 and styled using Tailwind CSS 4. The typography uses the Source Sans Pro font family for a clean, modern look.

Button States

1. Default
   The base state of the button with standard styling, providing a clear and intuitive call to action.

2. Hover
   When a user hovers over the button, the background color changes to provide visual feedback, enhancing interactivity.

3. Active
   Upon clicking, the button transitions to its active state, giving users tactile confirmation that their action has been registered.

4. Loading
   When clicked, the button displays a spinner for 2 seconds, indicating processing. The cursor also changes to a progress state, improving user experience by signaling ongoing activity.

5. Disabled
   If the button is clicked and becomes inactive, it shifts to a disabled state with subdued styling. The cursor updates to reflect the disabled status, preventing further interaction.
